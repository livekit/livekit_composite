## Agents (Python)


### Log message warning ``None of PyTorch...`

tldr; you can safely ignore this warning.

`None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, configuration and file/data utilities can be used.`

The message comes from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which checks for deep learning backends like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Flax. If none are installed, it issues a warning.

However, LiveKit's turn detector does not use Hugging Face for inference â€” it runs on ONNX, a separate runtime that does not require those backends.

Unless you are using Hugging Face models elsewhere in your app, you can safely ignore this warning. You can import PyTorch to get rid of the warning but it is not necessary.

### Python SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED - unable to get local issuer certificate

**Error**:
```
WARNING livekit.agents - failed to connect to livekit, retrying in 0s: 
Cannot connect to host abc-xyz.livekit.cloud:443 ssl:True 
[SSLCertVerificationError: (1, 
'[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1000)')]
```

**The fix:**

```
#This has fixed it for other Mac OS 15 users
pip install --upgrade certifi

# and whatever package manage you are using:
[apt|yum|brew]: reinstall ca-certificates

```

and check with:`python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"`


## Self Hosting LiveKit Server

## Krisp Noise Cancelation

[Enhanced noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/#overview) LiveKit cloud offers access to advanced models licensed from [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/) to remove background noise and ensure the best possible audio quality. This is currently not available for self hosted LiveKit servers.
