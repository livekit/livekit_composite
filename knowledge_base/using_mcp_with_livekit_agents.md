# Using MCP with LiveKit Agents

If you're looking to leverage a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol. io/) server with your LiveKit Agent, refer to [this example](https://github. com/livekit-examples/python-agents-examples/tree/85276882e8d191c71c60b192a86701e6afedc6f3/mcp) which demonstrates how to define and use an MCP server within your agent implementation.

We will be adding formal documentation for how to use MCP servers with Agents in the near future.
