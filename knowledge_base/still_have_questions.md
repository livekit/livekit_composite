# Still Have Questions

## Asking a Good Question?

(*In the voice of Jerry McGuire:* [Help Me Help You!](https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=T_3pFzfZFsw))

The community Slack group is hear to help. Share your issue in the Slack channel that seems most related to your issue. Things are moving very fast both with LiveKit and the industry so it will help everyone share important context about the issue like:


1. We need to know what version and resources of LiveKit you are using: Get your library Version like `pip freeze |grep livekit`Python version `python --version`
2. Tell us if you are just building your agent now or if it has been deployed in production for a while.
3. Tell us if there were any recent changes like code or you upgraded from one version of the LiveKit library to newer one
4. It is very helpful to know your use case so it is very helpful to not only tell was what is not working but also why you need if. We may have a better direction than the way your are heading for a specific scenario.
5. A link to your dashboard can help us a lot
6. Share you logs in the Slack thread that are relevant to your issue. Sharing a single line is usually not that help as we need context.
7. The room info like `RM_nnnnn` really helps us to find things in the logs. Time it happened and the relative timezone is also very helpful.
8. If the server is self hosted that is also super helpful to know. We don't have much visibility into self hosted so if you can reproduce same issue on Cloud that will help us help you.
9. If there is a GitHub issue open it is very helpful if you reference that somewhere in the slack thread.
