# Slack Etiquette

## General Slack Etiquette


1. Do not post multiple Slack messages on the same topic in the main slack thread back to back. Instead, use a single message or add more details in a Slack thread. This way a conversation does not get fragmented and is easier to follow.
2. Make sure "Also send to channel" is not checked when adding messages in a thread.
3. If you are having the "exact" same issue as someone else it is good to share your results in the same thread so we can all debug the same issue together. That said, please do not share unrelated issues in someone else's Slack thread about a specific topic.
4. When sharing code snippets, please post your code in your message's thread in order to keep the main channel readableEncasing the code in triple backticks (``` like this ```) will format it, making it easier to read
5. We love logs, but it is most helpful to have a concise description of your concern in the main message then put the details like logs and detailed debug information in the Slack thread. Logs are most helpful if you share a text file or the text directly. Screenshots of the log are less helpfulMore context from the log is better than less context.
6. Mentioning a LiveKit staff member in your initial message generally won't get you help any faster. In fact we've seen it can slow things down because then, others may be reluctant to answer the question. If you are in a slack thread and already working with someone on an issue, then it can be appropriate to mention the person you are working with. If a subject matter experts is needed, a LiveKit member knows who to mention or, more likely, has already started a private conversation to capture more details.
7. We get a LOT of DMs, and there are times when that is good for deep debugging sessions. But generally speaking, we do not respond to unsolicited DMs. If at all possible, start the conversation in a main channel and we will move it to a DM (or a call) if we need to chat about confidential information.
8. **Email Support** - We prefer Slack over email but if you do email us it is very helpful if you: Use the same email address as you used for your LiveKit accountInclude all the information that is asked below in the `Still Have Question?` section
